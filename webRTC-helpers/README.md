# webRTC-helpers

This directory contains executables for the helper programs for webRTC.

They are named `webRTC-peer-win.exe` or `webRTC-peer-macos.exe`.

They are built from repository <https://github.com/jvdrhoof/WebRTCSFU> and then checked
in here as binaries.

Note that for now we don't care about the Mac architecture, just use x86-64, which will run
fine on a Silicon mac.
